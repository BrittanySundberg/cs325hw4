Files for HW4 for CS 325

All files are on the engineering flip servers in sundbebr's folders on flip3. This project requires
an input file named act.txt that has the activity input information to run the algorithm on.
 
To run the files there on the flip3 servers, you need to go to that cs325hw4 folder. Then:

To run activity.py on the engineering flip servers, run the command line "python3 activity.py"

Running the file will print the results to the terminal, as instructed in the PDF instructions 
and as was told by the instructors in Piazza.
